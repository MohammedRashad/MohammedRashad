<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mohamed Rashad</h1>
            With 11+ years of experience in various multinationals & startups, interacting with a diverse set of problems. I've worked with software & hardware from building websites and apps, designing robots or developing machine learning applications, alongside experimenting with many ideas and trying to fulfill my curiosity by learning everything I can put my hands on.
            <br/> <br/>
I'm T-shaped minded person, interested in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary work, considering this, I work to find the links between different disciplines and integrate them for a solution. Trying to make this world better, by applying egnineering and spreading knowledge.
            <br/> <br/>
My focus is developing deep/high tech and delivering real value to business.
            <br/>
I am an early adopter of disruptive ideas, and I helped building multiple successful products across multiple domains, for example :<br/>
            â€¢ TAI Automation & Analytics Platform @ Nokia  <br/>
            â€¢ AI-Powered e-KYC Platform @ Digified <br/>
            â€¢ Talent Matchmaking Platform @ Lyrise <br/>
            â€¢ Tuba Auto AI-Vision Platform @ DevisionX <br/>
            ..also currently working on couple another products.     
<br/><br/>
            
I also work with the engineering community both as volunteer and professional, I've been an IEEE Volunteer for more than 7 years, both locally and globally, from being my local student branch chairman to organizing the largest programming competition in the planet, I also co-founded the first makerspace and fablab in the Suez Canal region (Fab Lab Ismailia) , taking the lead of the maker community in this region and accelerating the growth of the engineering & maker community.
            <br/> <br/>
I believe that empowering of the community is integral to advancing the engineering as a discipline, so my technical work and community-oriented work go hand in hand to fulfill my vision.
